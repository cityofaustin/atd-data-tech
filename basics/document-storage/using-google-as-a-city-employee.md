# Using Google as a City Employee

Using Google within these parameters ensures we comply with CTM's security protocols. We can fulfill PIRs, follow records-retention policies, and maintain access to employees' work when they leave the City.

## Account creation <a href="#account-creation" id="account-creation"></a>

Employees should not use personal Google accounts for City work since all City-related email correspondence must reside in Office 365. So you will need to create a Google account with your `@austintexas.gov` email address that is **not attached to a Gmail account**:&#x20;

1.  Visit [Create your Google Account](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?continue=https%3A%2F%2Faccounts.google.com%2FManageAccount\&gmb=exp\&biz=false\&flowName=GlifWebSignIn\&flowEntry=SignUp).

2. Click "Use my current email address instead."
3. Enter your `@austintexas.gov` email address.
4. Check your email, including your junk/spam folder, and confirm your account.

Remember, **never add a Gmail address to this account**! It's against City policy and creates a permissions headache for your supervisor.&#x20;

## Permissions <a href="#file-storage" id="file-storage"></a>

All your documents should be saved within a folder owned by a shared resource account, coaatdamd@austintexas.gov. This means we can all search and access each other's files, even if someone is out of the office or leaves the team.

## Sensitive information <a href="#sensitive-information" id="sensitive-information"></a>

**Under no circumstances should sensitive information be stored in Google Drive.** This includes [CJIS](https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/cjis-security-policy-resource-center) and [HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/index.html) data, along with any personally identifiable information about individuals in the community.
