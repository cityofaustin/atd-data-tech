# Document Storage

## DTS Google Drive

We love Google Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Slides for collaborative document editing and management. Since CTM does not have an enterprise Google subscription, we follow [these procedures](using-google-as-a-city-employee.md) carefully.&#x20;

Using Google within these parameters ensures we can fulfill PIRs, follow records-retention policies, and maintain access to employees' work when they leave the City.

To prevent the proliferation of different versions of multi-editor documents, all collaborative documents are stored in a single location:

* [Document templates](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Txqc8xGkwa3h9lrRoXGzGjLlVo0S8DA6)
* ​[DTS Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fNmU-czryk5wJsn1gmb4WYUJJdut8Me7)​ - [​account setup](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/wiki/Using-Google-as-a-City-employee)​​

## Windows-only File Types

GIS files, Visio documents, and other files that can only be used on a Windows operating system are stored on the [ATD departmental network G drive](https://coacd.org/dfs/ATD).

## Everything Else

Other documents can be stored in Google Drive or our G drive, whichever is most practical for the team and customer.

{% hint style="info" %}
Be aware that anything stored on your local drive — the Windows C drive or Mac HD — is not backed up or accessible via other devices. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

## **How to Connect to Network Drives on a Mac**

_You will need to be either hard-connected to the City network or_ [_connected via VPN_](https://atd-dts.gitbook.io/wiki/on-boarding#vpn-and-remote-access)_._ From Finder on Mac: _Go > Connect to Server_ then type the address in the _Server Address_ field

* H drive: `smb://coacd.org/home/PWDhome/[your username]`
* G drive: `smb://coacd.org/dfs/ATD`
