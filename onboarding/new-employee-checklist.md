# New Employee Checklist

{% hint style="info" %}
It's best practice to track onboarding in Github. The simplest option is to combine the lists below with the [new team member's to-dos](welcome-to-dts.md#to-dos) into a single "Onboard \[Name]" issue. Update and assign/`@`mention others where needed, including the employee themself once they're in Github.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Supervisor

* Submit a [CTM New Employee Request Form](https://atx.servicenowservices.com/sp?id=sc\_cat\_item\_guide\&sys\_id=b714eb12db7a3f0021ccef92ca961972) for a COA network account, eAccess PIN/HR Portal, and phone. Under "Network Account Information," write `Shared mailbox: transportation.data@austintexas.gov; Distribution lists: ATDDataTechnologyServices@austintexas.gov and TPWEmployees@austintexas.gov`&#x20;
