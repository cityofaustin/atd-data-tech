### Use of personal devices

If you use your personal computer for work at the any CoA office be advised that you should never directly connect to the CoA Ethernet network. You can connect to the CoA internal network via VPN when necessary. CTM runs occasional security scans for devices that shouldn't be on the network and if they discover your personal computer, they reserve the right to take your computer, run scans, and review files.
