# About

The [Data & Technology Services](https://austinmobility.io/) team at Austin Transportation and Public Works applies user-centered design, agile software delivery, and progressive civic tech values to build impactful solutions with Austin’s mobility planners, engineers, technicians, and staff.

We use many modern tools and technologies to deliver solutions to our stakeholders. We build enterprise business systems using [Knack](https://www.knack.com/), a no-code workflow management service, and we also have a team of developers who build custom software when out-of-the-box doesn’t cut it. We embrace mature frameworks with an eye toward maintainability and long-term stability. We love [web mapping](https://austin.maps.arcgis.com/home/search.html?restrict=false\&sortField=relevance\&sortOrder=desc\&searchTerm=owner%3A%22ATD\_Publisher%22#content) and champion [open source](https://github.com/orgs/cityofaustin/repositories?language=\&q=atd\&sort=\&type=all) and [open data](https://data.austintexas.gov/browse?Ownership\_Department-name=Austin+Transportation\&q=transportation) across the City of Austin.
