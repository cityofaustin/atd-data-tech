# Product Delivery Workflow

## New Project or Product Request

Whether submitted via the [DTS Service Request Portal](https://atd.knack.com/dts#new-service-request/), written on behalf of a customer, or documenting an idea from the DTS team, new requests go to the “New Issues” pipeline.

### Triage

* Confirm requestor authority and get clarification from customer if needed
* Create issue for Intake Meeting
  * Specify due date
  * Assign to PM
  * Apply appropriate milestone and move to _**Backlog**_ or _**On Deck**_ pipeline
* Add an _Index_ label
* Move to _**Needs Scoping**_ pipeline

{% hint style="info" %}
**Products** are the solutions we build for our customers, including Knack apps, AMANDA apps, custom software, and data systems. We improve and extend our products over time so that they deliver continuous value to Austin Transportation as business needs change. 

**Projects** are temporary endeavors — whether [identifying a vendor solution](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/issues/65), [building a major feature for an existing Product](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/issues/533), [overhauling a dataset](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/issues/254), or [delivering a complex map](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/issues/1911). They accomplish a singular goal and have a defined completion date.

### Scoping

* Assigned PM schedules Intake Meeting; Ideally this will include actual users as well as the workgroup manager

* Meet and take notes; photos may also be helpful

### Builder Huddle

* Schedule meeting with lead from each builder team and other PMs; could be very helpful to include any other builders likely to be working on the project
* Prepare summary of request; [example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1brqKe0IfavZ4K8Dp2jv1QBW_Kfa7umDROOiQ2lHc67I/edit#slide=id.p)

* Circle back with customer
  * Prioritization outcome and explanation
  * List of customer's existing feature, enhancements, + new application requests
  * Discuss where the project should fit into the backlog

### Activation
