# Product Delivery Workflow

## New Project or Product Request

Whether submitted via the [DTS Service Request Portal](https://atd.knack.com/dts#new-service-request/), written on behalf of a customer, or documenting an idea from the DTS team, new requests go to the “New Issues” pipeline.

### Triage

* Confirm requestor authority and get clarification from customer if needed
* Create issue for Intake Meeting
  * Specify due date
  * Assign to PM
  * Apply appropriate milestone and move to _**Backlog**_ or _**On Deck**_ pipeline
* Add an _Index_ label
* Move to _**Needs Scoping**_ pipeline

**Products **are the solutions we build for our customers, including Knack apps, AMANDA apps, custom software, and data systems. We improve and extend our products over time so that they deliver continuous value to Austin Transportation as business needs evolve.&#x20;

**Projects** are temporary endeavors — whether [identifying a vendor solution](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/issues/65), [building a major feature for an existing Product](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/issues/533), [overhauling a dataset](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/issues/254), or [delivering a complex map](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/issues/1911). They accomplish a singular goal and have a defined completion date.&#x20;

### Scoping

* Assigned PM schedules Intake Meeting; Ideally this will include actual users as well as the workgroup manager

* Meet and take notes; photos/recording may also be helpful
* Add notes/photos/recording to Github issue
* If necessary, update issue description to ensure it clearly summarizes request

### Builder Huddle

* Schedule meeting with lead from each builder team and other PMs; could be  helpful to include any other builders likely to be working on the project
* Prepare summary of request; [example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1brqKe0IfavZ4K8Dp2jv1QBW\_Kfa7umDROOiQ2lHc67I/edit#slide=id.p)
* Meet and discuss

### Product Work Session

* Circle back with customer
  * Prioritization outcome and explanation
  * List of customer's existing feature, enhancements, + new application requests
  * Discuss where the project should fit into the backlog

### Activation

* Add _Product_ or _Project_ label [here](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/labels) with the hex code #3D3D3D
* Add _Active_ label so it appears at [https://data.mobility.austin.gov/about](https://data.mobility.austin.gov/about/)
* Create new Drive folder in [_ATD DTS > Projects_](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZGTzTNd8SKWzg7qDCqtib5\_SX8nqBThx) and copy over docs from [_Project Template_](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SopoHWvd3IUgxaqq\_KLMccXFEGBm7vtZ)
* Assigned PM schedules Kickoff Meeting

## **Feature or Enhancement**

### Triage
