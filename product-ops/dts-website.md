# DTS Website Management

An issue will appear on the [projects](https://austinmobility.io/projects) or [products](https://austinmobility.io/products) listing if it:

* Has a `Product: xyz` or `Project: xyz` label
* Has as `Product Index` or `Project Index` label

In order for the **Evaluation **tab ([example](https://austinmobility.io/projects/307?tab=evaluation)) to render correctly, the project must have an evaluation completed in the [DTS Portal](https://atd.knack.com/dts#project-evaluation/). If you created a `Project Index` issue, it will automatically be created in the DTS Portal. Find your issue there and create the evaluation.

If your project is not listed in Knack, the ETL may not yet have run. You can manually create a new entry in Knack, just make sure you provide the correct github issue # when creating the entry. The ETL will overwrite any project name you supply manually.&#x20;
