# DTS Website Management

An issue will appear on the [projects](https://austinmobility.io/projects) or [products](https://austinmobility.io/products) listing if it:

* Has a `Product: xyz` or `Project: xyz` label
* Has as `Product Index` or `Project Index` label

In order for the **Evaluation **tab ([example](https://austinmobility.io/projects/307?tab=evaluation)) to render correctly, the project must have an evaluation completed in the [DTS Portal](https://atd.knack.com/dts#project-evaluation/). If you created a `Project Index` issue, it will automatically be created in the DTS Portal. Find your issue there and create the evaluation.
