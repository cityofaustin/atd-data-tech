# Index Issue Specifications

Project and product index issues allow us to centralize all of the information about a project or product. These issues follow a standardized labeling scheme and content format that allows them to be pulled into the [DTS Website](https://product.austinmobility.io) and enable us to efficiently track all related work.

{% hint style="info" %}
Create a new Project or Product Index by selecting the [appropriate issue template](https://github.com/cityofaustin/atd-data-tech/issues/new/choose) from the `atd-data-tech` repo
{% endhint %}
