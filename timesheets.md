# Work Schedule, timesheets, and leave

### Municipal Civl Service

The [Municipal Civil Service \(MCS\) ](https://www.austintexas.gov/department/municipal-civil-service-rules)rules govern the process for employee hiring, promotions, lateral transfers, reduction-in-force, disciplinary actions, and appeals. If any supplemental information included here conflict with the official MCS rules, those rules take  precedent.

### Work Schedule

All Austin Transportation Department employees are required to work 8.5 hours/day. That includes a mandatory 30-minute lunch. You can take a longer lunch, but can’t count it as work time. You can work through lunch, but you still need to put in 8.5 hours.

Your start time can range between 8am and 930am. We ask that you work the same schedule consistently and you post your daily stand-up when you log on.

When meetings get scheduled outside your regular work hours, you’re expected to attend them. Let your team lead know in advance when you're unable to attend a meeting that requires your attendance.

### Flexing Hours

You can flex your hours on occasion to accommodate doctor appointments, errands, etc., just give your team-lead a heads-up when you plan to do that \(understood that unexpected absences do come up\).

“Non-exempt”, aka "hourly" employees, can flex hours within a single work week \(Sunday-Saturday\), so long as you reach 40 total hours. "Exempt" employees can flex hours across the entire two-week pay period, so long as your hours total 80.

### Leave Time

If you can’t or don’t want to flex, you can use sick time for doctor appointments and personal time \(vacation, personal holiday hours, comp time, etc.\) for anything else.  You may also use leave without pay \(LWP\), but LWP require pre-approval and should be discussed with your supervisor at least two-weeks in advance.

Non-exempt employees are eligible for overtime and comp time, both of which require advance approval from your supervisor.

If you are a new permanent employee, you unfortunately can’t use vacation or personal holiday leave during your six-month probation period. If you need to take time off during probation period, you have three options: flex hours, use sick time, or take leave without pay.

Regardless of the type of leave you use, you must submit a leave request in advance through the eTimesheet system \(see below\).

### Timesheets

{% hint style="info" %}
During your first two weeks you'll have to fill out a paper timesheet. Request a blank paper timesheet from your supervisor by Day 3.
{% endhint %}

Your timesheet must be submitted in the [eTimesheet](https://pwdweb.austintexas.gov/timesheet/pwd.cfm) system every Thursday by 10am. 

Learn how to submit your timesheet with the  [E-Timesheet Training Guide](http://coaspweb1/sites/PWD/PWU/SitePages/ATDLearn.aspx) \(on-network\) and  [timesheet code](https://cityofaustin.sharepoint.com/sites/ATD/Administration/SitePages/Earn%20Codes.aspx) reference.
