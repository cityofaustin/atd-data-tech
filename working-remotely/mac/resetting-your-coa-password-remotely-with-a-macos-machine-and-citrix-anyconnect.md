# Resetting your CoA password remotely with a macOS machine & Citrix AnyConnect

### 1. Get setup with a PC assigned to your Citrix profile

You may have to reach out to Scott Reedy for assistance with this step, but you'll need a PC assigned to your Citrix profile. 

### 2. Connect to the VPN via Citrix AnyConnect

### 3. Log in to [Citrix Store Front](https://coastore.austintexas.gov/Citrix/COASTOREWeb/) using your CoA username and password

* URL: [https://coastore.austintexas.gov/Citrix/COASTOREWeb/](https://coastore.austintexas.gov/Citrix/COASTOREWeb/)
* Username format is `coacd\` then your last name and first initial. Ex: coacd\clarkem
* Password is your CoA password \(same as Outlook\)

### 4. Click on the Settings "cog" icon in the top right, then "Account Settings"

### 6. Fill out the Change Password form and click "OK"

### 7. Once you change your password in Citrix, immediately log out of AnyConnect 

It is possible to probably lock yourself out because you are logged into AnyConnect with the old password at that time. You can reach out to Scott Reedy to unlock you if that happens.
