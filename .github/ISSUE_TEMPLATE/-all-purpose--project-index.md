Instructions:
- Replace text between [[  ]] brackets with your own content. 
- Remove comments* like this, which only appear when you are editing the issue, once you no longer need them. 
- You probably won't have all this information until you scope the project—that's okay! Hide those sections as comments* so you can add them as you learn more.
