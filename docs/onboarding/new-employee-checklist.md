# Team Lead Checklist for New Employees

{% hint style="info" %}
Team leads are responsible for tracking new team members' onboarding in Github:&#x20;

Create an epic "Onboard \[Name]" with two issues:&#x20;

* "Perform \[Name] onboarding tasks \[Team Lead]," assigned to yourself and the new team member's supervisor—i.e. the person who will sign their timesheets. Copy and paste the checklist from this page into the issue body.&#x20;
* "Perform DTS onboarding tasks \[\[Name]]." You won't be able to assign this to the new team member until they have a Github username, but in the meantime you can direct them to the [Welcome to DTS](../../onboarding/welcome-to-dts.md) Gitbook page. &#x20;
* Add these checklists into the issue bodies. If you have issues with formatting, you can take these steps:&#x20;
  * &#x20;Copy text below
  * Convert it to Markdown using [Paste to Markdown](https://euangoddard.github.io/clipboard2markdown/)
  * Copy ☝️ and use [Text Cleaner](https://textcleaner.net/find-and-replace/) to replace bullet points with task lists. Find "`- "`and replace with "`- [ ]` "
{% endhint %}

## **Hardware & Office**

* [ ] Request necessary hardware from Scott. Do this as soon as possible to ensure he has enough lead time to acquire equipment. Make sure they get a **laptop**, **power** **supply**, **monitors**, **keyboard**, **mouse**, and **docking station**. Some team members also need a **CoA phone**.
* [ ] Coordinate with Diana to assign their desk and obtain an ergonomic chair.&#x20;

## **Network Account**&#x20;

### **Regular and Temporary Employees**

* [ ] Submit a [CTM New Employee Request Form](https://atx.servicenowservices.com/sp?id=sc\_cat\_item\_guide\&sys\_id=b714eb12db7a3f0021ccef92ca961972) for a COA network account, eAccess PIN/HR Portal, and phone. If the employee won't be using city issued equipment, use the Third-Party Remote Access Request Form instead. \
  \
  Under "Network Account Information," write `Shared mailbox: transportation.data@austintexas.gov; Distribution lists: ATDDataTechnologyServices@austintexas.gov and TPWEmployees@austintexas.gov`.

### Third-Party Equipment

* [ ] Submit a [Third-Party Remote Access Request Form](https://atx.servicenowservices.com/sp?id=sc\_cat\_item\&sys\_id=30f9aa09dba4a8106d0171f2399619a2) instead of a NERF. See [this guide ](https://cityofaustin.sharepoint.com/sites/ServiceNowFullfillerLearningResources/Final%20Quick%20Reference%20Guides/KB0011192.pdf)for more info.&#x20;

This will require the vendor to sign a third-party remote access acceptable use agreement. Find the latest version of the agreement form embedded in the service now request. This must be submitted with the ServiceNow request. &#x20;

## Next Steps

After the network account is created and you have their @austintexas.gov email address:

* [ ] Ask Amenity or Frank to add the new team member to the City of Austin [Transportation Github team](https://github.com/orgs/cityofaustin/teams/transportation/members). This should automatically add them to the [City of Austin Github organization](https://github.com/orgs/cityofaustin/people).
